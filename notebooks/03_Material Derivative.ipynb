    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The material derivative is the derivative with respect of time of a physical quantity of a fluid particle described by field variables which are fixed in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds rather complicated, but isn't. Consider you want to measure the velocity field of a fluid. Most conveniently you fix the coordinate system with the lab and measure at fixed points in this coordinate system the velocity field. You thus do not measure the velocity of single fluid particle moving through the particle but the velocity at specific points. How to we relate this measurement for example to the acceleration a fluid particle undergoes. If the flow is unsteady, i.e. the fluid velocity is time dependent, then you may want to define an acceleration of the fluid particle at postion $\\vb{x}$ with $$\\vb{a}=\\pad{\\vb{u}(\\vb{x},t)}{t}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is that all of the acceleration a fluid particle will experience?\n",
    "Before you answer this question let's have a look at the following steady (time independent) flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/pics/md_fig1.png\" width=300> <p> \n",
    "This is a called a fluid constriction. The fluid enters with a constant velocity from the left and exits on the right. Assume the fluid is incompressible, then the flow rate is fixed over the whole configuration; as the crossectional area changes so does the fluid velocity. The fluid on the left side has smaller velocity than on the right. Therefore, after a fluid particle enters it will be accelerated while moving through the constriction. The fluid velocity however is not a function of time, thus our acceleration as defined above would give us 0. Definitely above definition of acceleration is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do it right, we need to calculate the acceleration of a fluid particle differently, not only account for the change in time but also in space. For above fluid constriction, the geometry leads to an acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we derive formally the time derivative of a fluid particle by using only quantities which can be obtained from a fixed lab based coordinate system. Describing a flow with a lab based coordinate systems is termed Eulerian description. In contrast if we fix the fluid particle and describe its change in time we use the technical term Lagrangian description.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a scalar field variable, say the density $\\rho(\\vb{x},t)$. Consider we have measured the density of the fluid at every point in the flow using a lab based coordinate system.\n",
    "We want to know the change of the density of a fluid particle. We first have to define this fluid particle... that is easy, it is the fluid particle being at time $t=t_0$ at position $\\vb{x}=\\vb{x_0}=(x_{10},x_{20},x_{30})^T$. \n",

    "<div class=\"YourWork\">*Why is this unique?*</div>\n",
