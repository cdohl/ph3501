    "# Week 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the new semester. This week we start with an introduction of what fluids (gases and liquids) are and set the foundation for the first part of the course, *kinematics*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Introduction (8.8.2016)\n",
    "Please have a look at the [Teaser video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhmyQwDpkdc&index=1&list=PLFSK3FTDR0W8ixt8j7MTxobQqK1e6rSZB).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the adminstration and give a colorful introduction to the fluid mechanics. The [slides are available here](notebooks/pdf/Lecture1.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gases and liquids can be modeled with particles (non interacting and interacting). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations help to understand their behaviour and watch them in slow motion. As a first tutorial you need to play with a MD program. It is introduced in the Teaser Video 1 and can be [run in your browser](http://cav2012.sg/cdohl/ph3501/md/). For more information on how to run the program is available  [web site from Prof Schroeder](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/md/), please note that his version does not have the pressure graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get us all started, we rehearse some math. Please look and work through the [Math refresher notebook](notebooks/01 Math Refresher and Python Introduction.ipynb). This notebook also offers you with some first introduction into Python, the language we use in the course. A nice [introduction is given by Robert Johansson](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-Python-Programming.ipynb). Don't worry, we will slowly start with it. I'll motivate the use of a programming language in the course, and besides learning fluid mechanics you obtain some skills which increases your employability!\n",

    "## Introduction to Kinematics (10.8.2016)\n",
    "Please have a look at the [Teaser video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlKvwmH6NR8&list=PLFSK3FTDR0W8ixt8j7MTxobQqK1e6rSZB&index=2) which introduces Streamlines, Streaklines and Pathlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [slides are available here](notebooks/pdf/Lecture2.pdf), and the [notebook here](notebooks/02 Streamlines, Pathlines, Streaklines.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This and 2nd week material is covered in Pozrikidis chapter 1.4 & 1.5 .  \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrating Stream-Streak-Pathlines shown i the teaser video is available [here](notebooks/Example%20of%20Stream-Streak-Pathlines.ipynb). It works only with a newer version of Jupyter than the one installed on Pulasan. Either download it to your computer with an updated Jupyter server or use it by uploading onto https://try.jupyter.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your are interested in the Molecular Tagging Technique (which demonstrates true particle pathes) you may want to have a look at [this book chapter](notebooks/pdf/MTV_2007-Springer-Book-Chapter-final.pdf). \n",

    "\n",
    "# Week 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Kinematics (15.8.2016)\n",
    "We repeat the concepts of streamline and pathline and introduce on the streaklines. Examples will be given. The pathlines can be calculated by solving the ordinary differential equation, yet in many cases no analytical solutions are available and we have to use a computer to obtain a numerical one. A standard technique is called the [Euler method](notebooks/02a Euler%20Method.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow field decomposition (17.8.2016)\n",
    "Using a lab based coordinate system is convenient but leads to the fact that the fluid particle's acceleration is not only a function of time, but of space, too. We derive the acceleration of a fluid particle at a point in lab space and name it [material derivative](notebooks/03 Material%20Derivative.ipynb). \n",
    "The [decomposition of a flow field](notebooks/04_Flow%20Field.ipynb) allows to quantify the deformation caused by linear straining, rotation, and shear.\n",

    "# Week 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Repeat and principle axis decomposition  (22.8.2016)\n",
    "We continued with the [last week's notebook](notebooks/04_Flow%20Field.ipynb) and describe the transformation of a shear flow into a linear straining flow by rotation of the coordinate axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rotating Flows (24.8.2016)\n",
    "Solid body rotation and the irrotational vortex are two kind of rotating flows in 2 dimensions. They are [discussed in this notebook](notebooks/05_Solid Body Rotation & Irrotational Vortex.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "A good video comparing both rotating flows [is available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVKleybMn6I).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sources, Flow Rate and Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of flow going through and area and a line is quantified with the *volumetric flow rate*. [We derive the equations](notebooks/06_Flow Rate & Flux.ipynb) and quantify the source strength within a volume or area in the flow field.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Streamfunction, Velocity Potential, Laplace Equation\n",
    "The lecture slides [are available here](notebooks/pdf/BengHauLecture3108.pdf). We also discuss the numerical solution of the Laplace equation based on finite differences and an iterative solution scheme. Please have a look at the [Teaser video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-oQvBgBRGM) which introduces the scheme for a simple and one dimensional problem before you [dive into the notebook](notebooks/07_Solving the Laplace Equation numerically.ipynb).\n",

    "Fluid Stresses at interfaces [are discussed here](notebooks/11b Fluid Stresses at Interfaces.ipynb). The stresses at a fluid interface are presented with a non-trivial example, namely the shape of a [droplet in a gravitational field](notebooks/12_Sessile droplet problem.ipynb). You may want to check out [an interactive notebook](notebooks/12a_Sessile Droplet Code interact.ipynb) to play with (does not work on pulasan yet). **Midterm exam!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Week 9\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Navier Stokes equation](notebooks/13_Navier Stokes Equation.ipynb) is derived by choosing a suitable relation between rate of strain and shear rate, the so-called consititutive equation for a Newtonian liquid. We don't yet solve the Navier Stokes Equation analytically, yet we can use a [numerical solver](notebooks/13a_Navier Stokes example.ipynb) to understand the effect of viscosity.\n",
    "Next, we will derive the [Bernoulli Equations](notebooks/14_Bernoulli Equation.ipynb) from the N.S. equation. They allow us solving many flow problems mostly along a streamline. We solve the [collapse of a spherical void](notebooks/14a_Rayleigh_ODE.ipynb) as an example for an unsteady Bernoulli problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Week 10\n",
    "We discusse [dynamic similarity](notebooks/15_Dimensional Analysis.ipynb) and then obtain an analytical the solution for the Navier Stokes equation for [steady planar flows](notebooks/16 Analytical solutions to steady and laminar flows.ipynb). \n",
